## About
This site was built for practicing HTML elements and structuring web pages. It was modeled after retro early 2000's web pages due to their simplistic layout and ease of replication. I built simple page navigation with links to other static pages.

### Features

* Working links to other pages on the site
* Simple elements laid out in a visually pleasing manner

### Built With

* Front End
